// In the filter component, there is a new input field for searching our list. When the user types in this field, the 
// list of items should be filtered so 
// that only items with names that match the text are included.
// Determine where you need to add state for this feature. What components need to know about the search text?
// Once you've determined which component should hold the state for this feature, set up your initial state, and 
// connect that state to the input field. Remember, we're trying to make this input a controlled input — so the input's 
// value should always be in sync with state. After you've connected the input to state, you'll also need to find a way to 
// set state when the input changes. To get the test passing, you'll need to use a prop called onSearchChange as a callback.
// Finally, after making those changes, you'll need to use that state value to determine which items are being displayed on 
// the page, similar to how the category dropdown works. Note: you may be asking yourself, why are we making this input 
// controlled when the <select> element is not a controlled input? Well, the <select> input should probably be controlled as 
// well! The tests don't require it, but feel free to update the <select> element to be a controlled element.
